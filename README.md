## Insights:
Agent Performance: Some agents consistently handle more calls than others, and certain agents exhibit faster response times.
Answered vs Unanswered Calls: There is a significant difference in the number of answered vs unanswered calls, indicating areas for improvement in call handling.
Satisfaction Ratings: Agents with higher satisfaction ratings tend to have a better response time, improving customer experience.
Call Volume Trend: Call volume fluctuates over time, with noticeable spikes during specific periods (e.g., holidays, weekends).
Resolution Rates: A high percentage of calls are resolved in a timely manner, but there are still unresolved calls that need attention.
